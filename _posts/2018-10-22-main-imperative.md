# Main imperative

The main imperative of the programming is to manage the complexity. 

Why is that? Because the most scarce resource any programmer has is 
his/her brainpower. Thus a good programmer is not the one that can
understand complicated systems,Â but the one that can write a simple 
instead.

Complexity management is the tool that we use to reduce mental load 
at any given moment in time.
