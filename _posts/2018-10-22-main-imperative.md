The main imperative of the programming is to manage complexity.

Why is that? Because the most scarce resource any programmer has 
is his/her brainpower. Thus a good programmer is not the one that 
can understand complicated systems, but the one that can write a 
simple instead.

Complexity management is the tool that we use to reduce mental 
load at any given moment in time. We extract, we separate, we hide, 
we abstract, we comment, we declare non-obvious and make explicit 
what was implicit, so that every little and big piece can be 
digestible and independent and its role is clear and visible in 
total picture.
